  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Effective date: February 12, 2026</p>

  <p>Jealousy Helper is a mobile app that provides guided support during moments of jealousy. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
  <p>All personal information you enter — including your nickname, pronouns, session history, and preferences — is stored locally on your device using on-device storage. This data never leaves your phone and is not transmitted to any server.</p>
  <p>Deleting the app removes all locally stored data.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>We use <a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Mixpanel</a> to collect anonymous usage events such as session starts, session completions, and whether a session was helpful. These events are tied to a randomly generated device identifier — not your name, email, or any personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p>Analytics help us understand how the app is used so we can improve it.</p>

  <h2>Error reporting</h2>
  <p>We use <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">Sentry</a> to collect crash reports and error logs. These reports include technical information about the error and your device (OS version, app version) but do not include any personal content from your sessions.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>In-app purchases and subscriptions are processed by Apple through the App Store. We use <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat</a> to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID and purchase receipts from Apple. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

  <h2>Data we do NOT collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any contact information.</li>
    <li>We do not require an account or login.</li>
    <li>We do not collect or store the content of your session responses.</li>
    <li>We do not sell, share, or rent any data to third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not use advertising or ad tracking.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services, each with their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Mixpanel</a> — anonymous analytics</li>
    <li><a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">Sentry</a> — error reporting</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/">RevenueCat</a> — subscription management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>Jealousy Helper is not intended for children under 17. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this policy, we will update the effective date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
